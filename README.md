# student_mat_EDA
Assignment from course "Principel of DataScience": Performing the data cleaniing and EDA.

## Tasks
1. Data Cleaning
* To understand how our data looks like, extract the first five lines of data.
* Check if there are typos and missing data. If so, correct the typos, list and
delete the rows contain missing data.
* Save the cleaned data as a .csv file.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section, please describe your findings for each question base on the plots
below. All plots need to have appropriate labels, titles and coordinates. You can also
annotate the plots where needed. The ggplot2 is recommended if you are using R.
* Generate violin plots for all three periods of grades (in one plot).
* Plot a bar chart for the 'address','traveltime' and `G3' variables.
* Creat a new variable 'Gmean', which is the mean of 'G1', 'G2','G3'. Plot the
densities of `Gmean', separately according to the variable `school' (display
the density curves in the same figure).
* Plot the scatter plot of 'G1' and 'G2', 'G1' and 'G3', 'G2' and 'G3'.

3. More Analysis
Suppose you are invited to provide suggestions that can improve students' perfor-
mance using the dataset: 'student-mat.csv'. Which variables you think is important
that affect students' final grades? Please illustrate the reason you choose these vari-
ables and provide EDA when it is necessary. And provide some advice to improve
students' performance.
